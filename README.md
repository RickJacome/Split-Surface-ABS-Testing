# Split-Surface-ABS-Testing


## The current repository contains the data used in the article called:

## Coefficients of Friction Determination on Split Testing Beds with ABS

* Each excel document named ABS-###-SLICE1-Output.xlsx contains the raw data for the specific cases discussed in the paper.

* Instrumentation devices as described in the paper include a sampling rate of 10 kHz, and a 1650 Hz (CFC 1000) anti-aliasing filter.
 
* SLICE-Compiled-Test-Data.xlsx and SLICE-Data-Plots.xlsx 
provides a compiled version of all testing cases with visuals.

* Summary-COF-Values contains the obtained COF tabulation used in the paper.

* Subfolder Raw Data contains the raw data obtained from the sensor along with other technical information from the sensor. Naming convention is assumed in the same order as appearing on the output files. (For reference mapping from raw folder to output files: FC1 = ABS-2, FC2 = ABS-3, FG1 = ABS-4, FG2 = ABS-5, FS1 = ABS-6, FS2 = ABS-7, SG1 = ABS-8, SG2 = ABS-9, SS1 = ABS-10, SS2 = ABS-11)
